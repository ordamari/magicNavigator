# Magic Navigator

In the first time i saw this navigator in the youtube ( [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArTVfdHOB-M) )  i was shocked, i can't stop thiking about this video until i decide to build this navigator for fun,

I decide to build it in react and to do the adjustments for that, after i finish that i understund that the code is not easy to change, and if i will want to use it in the future i can't do that without repeat the code to understand what to do, after that i decide to do litle changes to allow future use in this amazing navigation
